### Research vision: brain maps, cartograms and blueprints

A constant element in my research are brain maps. What is a brain map? Is the result of some MRI acquisition? In a sense, even a simple clinical scan allows us to look at something hidden in our skull. However, the brain has such a complex structure, articulated in so many levels, that a map cannot be uniquely defined. Even the holy grail of hardcore connectomics, a full diagram of every synapsis, would still be missing elements: what about the myelin? What about the glia? I prefer to think about this overwhelmingly complexity as richness: there are many perspectives to consider, and each of them can give a unique insight. 

### BaMBoo: building a meaningful biomarker of myelin

The brain can be imagined as a web of interconnected elements. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which offers a harmless way to take snapshots of living human brains, it is possible to appreciate the difference between grey matter regions, where specific functions are carried out, and white matter bundles, which constitute an effective transport system to integrate those
functions together. An important element still not clear from this highway system is the one that allows faster transport: myelin. Although the first quantitative measures have been proposed, there is the important need to properly validate them and understand how they can offer insights on function.

The **BaMBoo** project, funded by the Wellcome Trust through a [Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/people-and-projects/grants-awarded/bamboo-building-meaningful-biomarker-myelin), aims to define a meaningful measure of myelin, first using the comparison between MRI and microscopy and then using a non-invasive stimulation technique to improve brain function predictions. I will use it to characterise multiple sclerosis, the most common disease where myelin is affected.
