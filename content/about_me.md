### Biosketch

I am on a quest for better maps of the brain. A biomedical engineer by training, I got my BSc from the University of Rome "Sapienza" in 2011, followed by a MSc from the University of Rome "Roma Tre" in 2013. My PhD has been focused on multimodal brain connectivity using a combination of MRI and non-invasive stimulation, collaborating with the Italian National Institute of Health, the Santa Lucia Foundation and the University of Sussex.

After the viva voce in 2017, I joined the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC) of University College London as a postdoctoral researcher to expand my horizons, focusing first on using tractography to inform [surgery planning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/research/departments/clinical-and-experimental-epilepsy/research-themes/ucl-epilepsy-imaging-group-6#) and then switching to a different project aimed at [combining MRI with histology](https://sites.google.com/site/jeiglesias/bungee-tools).

In 2018 I have been awarded a [Sir Henry Wellcome fellowship](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/people-and-projects/grants-awarded/bamboo-building-meaningful-biomarker-myelin) from the Wellcome Trust for the BaMBoo project, focused on building meaningful biomarkers of myelin. In this project, I am working with Polytechnique Montreal, Cardiff University and University of Sussex. More details about my career are available on the [research page](../research).

When I am not thinking about brains, I like playing around with open-source code, travelling (at least when travelling was a thing!), reading Hacker News, looking for old videogames, and taking pictures (usually in this order). Other random/fun facts: I have two cats, I am in the very slow process of learning Portuguese and I make/bake/cook stuff.


### This blog

NeuroSnippets is a blog about exploring brain data/pictures/knowledge through open-source code. That means brain stuff as well as programming and visualization more in general, but always with some interesting/curious/insane application to neuroscience. 

Every post usually include snippets of code to try out, and the code is also available on the GitHub repository [NeuroSnippets](https://github.com/matteomancini/neurosnippets).
NeuroSnippets is statically generated using Hugo (from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/matteomancini/neurosnippets-hugo-blog)) and uses a customized version of the [m10c theme](https://github.com/matteomancini/hugo-theme-m10c).
